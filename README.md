Hello! My name is Intan Paramitha and this is my **Profile Page** for SL 05 assignment. To complete SL 05 assignment in Laravel, I have already implemented Template Blade, Controller, Route, If-Else, For Each, and Bootstrap.

This Profile page contains **Introduction**, **Hobbies**, **Skills**, and **Experiences**. Each section can be reached from the Navigation Bar. Aside from that, you might also find me on some social platforms that I have put in the Footer, we can become friends!

### Introduction

This section tells a few things you need to know about me, a short introduction in general and my goals. It also shows my **Education History** and my **Recent Works**. It's just some of my projects that I have worked on during college, both individual and group. I have **HiraBeats** for my individual work and for my group project, there are **FuGemy** and **B-Lib**.

### Hobbies

Among the several hobbies I have, I chose to just show the Top 3 of it, which are **Music** (listening to songs, singing, playing guitar), **Watching** (movie, drama), and **Reading** (books). This section is quite special, as I implemented the needs of SL 05 here.

When you select one of the hobbies displayed, you will be directed to each page, where it already contains a list of songs or movies or books that I like. It's also been **categorized based on my Top 3 Genre**. My top 1st genre would have the **gold** color for its background when you hover over it, **silver** background for the 2nd, and **bronze** on 3rd. Then, if you select any of them, you will be able to see **brief information about that specific item**.

### Skills

In this section, I wanted to show some of the hard skills that I got as a Computer Science student during college i.e. **PHP**, **Python**, **MySQL**, and **HTML-CSS-JS**, by the progress bars. 

### Experiences

Apart from academics, I want to continue trying to develop myself by participating in  organizational activities or events. So, this section shows some of my experiences participating on four events, such as **Charity Action of RTB 2023**, **RTB Gold Festival 2022**, **Egg-Venger Hunt Paskah 2022**, and **Multiple RTB Live Music 2022**.
